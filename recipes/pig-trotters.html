        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for trotters passed down over time in my family. This was made every New Year's Eve to bring in the new year. A relatively inexpensive African-American dish. Very delicious!</p>
        <p>Serve with homemade potato salad, Southern style greens and candied yams and cornbread. It is even better the next day, and it freezes well. Serve sprinkled with a little more vinegar or hot sauce to taste.</p>
