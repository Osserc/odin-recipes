<h1>Exercise: make a cookbook</h1>
<p>The assignment revolved around the construction of a simple cookbook using webpages.</p>
<p>In the completion of this assignment I had the chance to work on the basics of webpages:
    <ul>
        <li>Setting up html boilerplates</li>
        <li>Setting up an index page</li>
        <li>Setting up directories for recipe pages and images</li>
        <li>Constructing the recipe pages with the use of images, headings, paragraphs and lists, including nested lists</li>
        <li>Populating the index with a list of curated recipes with proper links</li>
        <li>Including a way to get back to the index from a recipe page</li>
    </ul>
