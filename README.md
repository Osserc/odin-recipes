Exercise: make a cookbook
The assignment revolved around the construction of a simple cookbook using webpages.
In the completion of this assignment I had the chance to work on the basics of webpages:
- Setting up html boilerplates
- Setting up an index page
- Setting up directories for recipe pages and images
- Constructing the recipe pages with the use of images, headings, paragraphs and lists, including nested lists
- Populating the index with a list of curated recipes with proper links
- Including a way to get back to the index from a recipe page
